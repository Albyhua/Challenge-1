# Horiseon Start-up

## Description
A client, Horiseon, came up to us to help with their code with their newly developed website from their junior engineer. Our client request that we look through the code and see any issues while maintaining the original look of what was sent to us (the manager really liked the page and did not want any major changes). The webpage was sent completed when sent to us, however, there was code that could be be changed without changing the website.

## What was solved
With a few iterations, we were able to clean up the code to a comfortable state while upholding the intergrity of the website. THe junior engineer had many redundant code in CSS where selectors did the same thing so we linked selectors with the same output to one common selector which cleared up multiple lines of code while executing the same output. On HTML, I was able to clean up the look of the code so it looked more thorough and less bloated. There was some questionable code which I deleted which still kept the integrity of the website intact. With the imagess, an Alt= was placed in on each of the images if their was any issues with the image not loading, a description of the image will place hold for the image.
